# FrontendTakeHomeAssignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.2.

**Demo** [https://alisterlf.github.io/frontend-take-home-assignment/](https://alisterlf.github.io/frontend-take-home-assignment/)

## Considerations

- I've decided to use Angular because it is the framework/library that i know most of best practices and techniques.
- As discussed by email, I made some layout adjustments to make it more symmetrical.
- I've decided to use the native `<input type="month"/>` to make the month picker, because it is very fast and has a great experience on mobile, and a good experience on desktop (it is fairly easy to customize to meet some layout choices).
